# StatML: Inference-Aware optimisation
Repository to store tutorial for StatML lecture.

You will need the following libraries to run the notebook:
```
torch
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
sklearn
tqdm
scipy
```
If you have a setup with these libraries installed, then feel free to clone this repository and run the notebook locally.

Otherwise you can run in Google colab: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jonathon-langford/statml/blob/main/inference_aware_optimisation.ipynb). 

Make sure to clear output before starting (no spoilers!): `Edit > Clear all outputs`

Enjoy!
